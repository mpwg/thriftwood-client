# Fix: Settings and Radarr Navigation Not Working

**Date**: October 7, 2025  
**Status**: ✅ Fixed  
**Issue**: Navigation buttons in Settings and Radarr not working  
**Branch**: `feature/phase-1-hierarchical-navigation`

## Problem

### Symptoms

- Buttons in Settings view (Profiles, Appearance, etc.) did nothing when tapped
- Similar issue likely in Radarr navigation
- Console showed errors:

  ```text
  Only root-level navigation destinations are effective for a navigation stack with a homogeneous path.
  cannot add handler to 4 from 1 - dropping
  cannot add handler to 3 from 1 - dropping
  ```

### Root Cause

Both `SettingsCoordinatorView` and `RadarrCoordinatorView` were **missing their own NavigationStack**. They were trying to use `.navigationDestination(for:)` without having a NavigationStack bound to their coordinator's path.

**The Issue:**

```text
MainAppNavigationView (NavigationStack for AppRoute)
  └── SettingsCoordinatorView (NO NavigationStack!)
        └── SettingsView
              └── .navigationDestination(for: SettingsRoute.self)  ❌ FAILED
```

SwiftUI error occurred because:

1. `MainAppNavigationView` creates a `NavigationStack` bound to `AppCoordinator.navigationPath` (uses `AppRoute`)
2. When Settings was pushed, `SettingsCoordinatorView` was inside this existing NavigationStack
3. `SettingsCoordinatorView` tried to add navigation destinations for `SettingsRoute` type
4. SwiftUI doesn't allow different route types in the same NavigationStack

## Solution

Each coordinator view that manages its own navigation state needs **its own NavigationStack** bound to its coordinator's `navigationPath`.

### Changes Made

#### 1. SettingsCoordinatorView.swift

**Before** (WRONG):

```swift
struct SettingsCoordinatorView: View {
    @Bindable var coordinator: SettingsCoordinator

    var body: some View {
        SettingsView(coordinator: coordinator)  // ❌ No NavigationStack
            .navigationDestination(for: SettingsRoute.self) { route in
                destinationView(for: route)
            }
    }
}
```

**After** (CORRECT):

```swift
struct SettingsCoordinatorView: View {
    @Bindable var coordinator: SettingsCoordinator

    var body: some View {
        NavigationStack(path: $coordinator.navigationPath) {  // ✅ Added NavigationStack
            SettingsView(coordinator: coordinator)
                .navigationDestination(for: SettingsRoute.self) { route in
                    destinationView(for: route)
                }
        }
    }
}
```

#### 2. RadarrCoordinatorView.swift

**Before** (WRONG):

```swift
struct RadarrCoordinatorView: View {
    @Bindable var coordinator: RadarrCoordinator

    var body: some View {
        radarrHomeView()  // ❌ No NavigationStack
            .navigationDestination(for: RadarrRoute.self) { route in
                destination(for: route)
            }
    }
}
```

**After** (CORRECT):

```swift
struct RadarrCoordinatorView: View {
    @Bindable var coordinator: RadarrCoordinator

    var body: some View {
        NavigationStack(path: $coordinator.navigationPath) {  // ✅ Added NavigationStack
            radarrHomeView()
                .navigationDestination(for: RadarrRoute.self) { route in
                    destination(for: route)
                }
        }
    }
}
```

### Navigation Hierarchy (After Fix)

```text
MainAppNavigationView
  └── NavigationStack(path: $appCoordinator.navigationPath) [AppRoute]
        ├── AppHomeView
        ├── ServicesHomeView
        ├── RadarrCoordinatorView
        │     └── NavigationStack(path: $radarrCoordinator.navigationPath) [RadarrRoute] ✅
        │           ├── RadarrHomeView
        │           ├── MoviesListView
        │           └── MovieDetailView
        └── SettingsCoordinatorView
              └── NavigationStack(path: $settingsCoordinator.navigationPath) [SettingsRoute] ✅
                    ├── SettingsView
                    ├── ProfileListView
                    └── AddProfileView
```

## Testing

### Build & Test Results

```bash
# Build
xcodebuild -project Thriftwood.xcodeproj -scheme Thriftwood -configuration Debug
# Result: ✅ BUILD SUCCEEDED

# Tests
xcodebuild test -project Thriftwood.xcodeproj -scheme Thriftwood -destination 'platform=macOS'
# Result: ✅ TEST SUCCEEDED
```

### Manual Testing Checklist

- [x] Navigate to Settings from home screen
- [x] Tap "Profiles" button → Should navigate to profile list
- [x] Tap "Appearance" button → Should navigate to appearance settings
- [x] Tap other settings buttons → Should navigate correctly
- [x] Use back button → Should pop back to previous screen
- [x] Navigate to Radarr module
- [x] Test Radarr sub-navigation
- [x] Verify no console errors

## Key Learnings

### The Golden Rule

> **Each coordinator view creates ONE NavigationStack bound to its coordinator's path.**  
> **Content views NEVER create NavigationStacks.**

### Where NavigationStack Goes

| View Type        | NavigationStack? | Example                                              |
| ---------------- | ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Coordinator View | ✅ YES           | `SettingsCoordinatorView`, `RadarrCoordinatorView`   |
| Content View     | ❌ NO            | `SettingsView`, `ProfileListView`, `MovieDetailView` |
| Root App View    | ✅ YES           | `MainAppNavigationView`                              |
| Modal/Sheet      | ✅ Optional      | New presentation context                             |

### Why This Pattern?

1. **Type Safety**: Each NavigationStack works with one route type
2. **Isolation**: Each coordinator manages its own navigation state
3. **Hierarchy**: Parent coordinators can push child coordinator views
4. **Flexibility**: Child coordinators have independent navigation
5. **No Conflicts**: Different route types don't interfere

## Prevention

To avoid this issue in the future:

1. **Always check**: Does this view manage navigation state?
2. **If YES**: It's a coordinator view → Add NavigationStack
3. **If NO**: It's a content view → No NavigationStack
4. **Review**: Check [NAVIGATION_ARCHITECTURE.md](../architecture/NAVIGATION_ARCHITECTURE.md) decision tree
5. **Test**: Verify navigation works before committing
