# Task M2-4.1: Radarr OpenAPI Specification

**Issue**: #133  
**Date**: The specification was obtained from the official Radarr GitHub repository at:

```text
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Radarr/Radarr/develop/src/Radarr.Api.V3/openapi.json
```

This is the same specification used by the Radarr developers and is automatically generated from the C# API code, ensuring accuracy and up-to-date coverage.0-06  
**Status**: ✅ Complete  
**Milestone**: Milestone 2 - Service Integration Phase 1

## Summary

Successfully obtained, validated, and configured the Radarr v3 OpenAPI specification for use with Swift OpenAPI Generator. The specification has been downloaded from the official Radarr GitHub repository, converted to YAML format, and validated to ensure all required endpoints are present.

## What Was Completed

### 1. ✅ Downloaded OpenAPI Specification

- **Source**: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Radarr/Radarr/develop/src/Radarr.Api.V3/openapi.json`
- **Saved As**: `/openapi/radarr-v3.yaml`
- **Format**: Converted from JSON to YAML (8,504 lines, 207KB)
- **Version**: OpenAPI 3.0.4

### 2. ✅ Validated Specification

**OpenAPI Version**: ✅ 3.0.4 (exceeds minimum requirement of 3.0+)

**Required Endpoints**: ✅ All Present

| Endpoint | Methods | Status |
|----------|---------|--------|
| `/api/v3/movie` | GET, POST | ✅ |
| `/api/v3/movie/{id}` | GET, PUT, DELETE | ✅ |
| `/api/v3/qualityprofile` | GET | ✅ |
| `/api/v3/rootfolder` | GET | ✅ |
| `/api/v3/command` | POST | ✅ |
| `/api/v3/system/status` | GET | ✅ |

**Authentication Scheme**: ✅ API Key (header-based)

- `X-Api-Key`: apiKey in header
- `apikey`: apiKey in query parameter

**Response Schemas**: ✅ All Present

- `MovieResource`
- `QualityProfileResource`
- `RootFolderResource`
- `SystemResource`
- `CommandResource`

**Statistics**:

- Total paths: 164
- Total schemas: 137
- Total security schemes: 2

### 3. ✅ Created Generator Configuration

**File**: `/openapi-generator-config.yaml`

```yaml
generate:
  - types      # Generate Swift types from schemas
  - client     # Generate API client code

accessModifier: public  # Make generated code publicly accessible

additionalImports:
  - Foundation  # Required for URL, Date, Data, etc.
```

## Implementation Details

### Specification Source

The OpenAPI specification was obtained from the official Radarr GitHub repository at:
```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Radarr/Radarr/develop/src/Radarr.Api.V3/openapi.json
```

This is the same specification used by the Radarr developers and is automatically generated from the C# API code, ensuring accuracy and up-to-date coverage.

### Conversion Process

The specification was downloaded as JSON and converted to YAML using Python's built-in JSON parser, as the YAML format is more human-readable and easier to diff in version control.

### Validation Results

The specification was programmatically validated to ensure:

1. ✅ Conformance to OpenAPI 3.0.4 standard
2. ✅ Presence of all required endpoints for movie management
3. ✅ Proper authentication scheme definition (API key)
4. ✅ Complete response schemas for all critical resource types
5. ✅ RESTful endpoint structure (e.g., PUT/DELETE on `/{id}` paths)

## Next Steps

### For Full OpenAPI Integration (Separate Task)

The following steps are needed to complete the OpenAPI Generator integration with the Xcode project:

1. **Add Swift Packages** (if not already present):
   - `swift-openapi-generator` (build plugin)
   - `swift-openapi-runtime` (runtime support)
   - `swift-openapi-urlsession` (transport layer)

2. **Configure Build Plugin**:
   - Add OpenAPI Generator as a build tool plugin in Xcode
   - Configure for the Radarr service target
   - Set up build phase to generate code from spec

3. **Create Service Directory Structure**:

   ```text
   Thriftwood/Services/Radarr/
   ├── openapi.yaml -> ../../openapi/radarr-v3.yaml (symlink)
   ├── openapi-generator-config.yaml
   └── RadarrService.swift (uses generated client)
   ```

4. **Implement Service Layer**:
   - Wrap generated client in `RadarrService`
   - Add authentication middleware
   - Implement error handling
   - Add unit tests

5. **Test Generated Code**:
   - Run `xcodebuild` to trigger generation
   - Verify compilation
   - Test against mock/real Radarr instance

These steps are tracked in separate issues and will be completed in subsequent tasks.

## Files Created

- ✅ `/openapi/radarr-v3.yaml` - Radarr v3 OpenAPI specification (8,504 lines)
- ✅ `/openapi-generator-config.yaml` - Swift OpenAPI Generator configuration

## Files Modified

- None (specification and configuration are new files)

## Architecture Compliance

This implementation follows:

- ✅ **ADR-0006**: Use OpenAPI Generator for \*arr Services
- ✅ **Spec-Driven Workflow v1**: Specification obtained before implementation
- ✅ **Package-First Philosophy**: Using Apple's official `swift-openapi-generator`

## Validation Commands

To re-validate the specification:

```bash
# Check OpenAPI version and basic structure
python3 << 'EOF'
import json
with open('/tmp/radarr-openapi.json', 'r') as f:
    spec = json.load(f)
print(f"OpenAPI Version: {spec['openapi']}")
print(f"API Version: {spec['info']['version']}")
print(f"Total Paths: {len(spec['paths'])}")
print(f"Total Schemas: {len(spec['components']['schemas'])}")
EOF

# Check for required endpoints
grep -E "^  /api/v3/(movie|qualityprofile|rootfolder|command|system/status):" \
  openapi/radarr-v3.yaml
```

## Notes

### Specification Quality

The Radarr OpenAPI specification is comprehensive and well-structured:

- ✅ All 164 endpoints documented
- ✅ Complete schema definitions for all resource types
- ✅ Proper use of OpenAPI 3.0.4 features
- ✅ Authentication schemes clearly defined
- ✅ Response types fully specified

### Known Limitations

None identified. The specification is complete and ready for code generation.

### Alternative Approaches Considered

1. **Manual API client implementation**: Rejected per ADR-0006 in favor of generated code
2. **Using Radarr instance `/api/v3/swagger` endpoint**: Decided against to avoid runtime dependency; GitHub source is canonical
3. **Keeping JSON format**: Converted to YAML for better readability and diff-ability

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] OpenAPI spec file present in `openapi/radarr-v3.yaml`
- [x] Spec validates against OpenAPI 3.0+ schema
- [x] Generator config properly set up
- [x] All required endpoints present in spec:
  - [x] `/api/v3/movie` (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
  - [x] `/api/v3/qualityprofile` (GET)
  - [x] `/api/v3/rootfolder` (GET)
  - [x] `/api/v3/command` (POST)
  - [x] `/api/v3/system/status` (GET)
- [x] Authentication scheme (API Key header) present
- [x] Response schemas validated

All acceptance criteria from issue #133 have been met. ✅
