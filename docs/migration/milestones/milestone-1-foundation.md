# Milestone 1: Foundation

**Duration**: Weeks 1-3  
**Goal**: Establish core architecture and infrastructure  
**Deliverable**: Basic app shell with navigation and data layer

## Week 1: Project Setup & Architecture

### Task 1.1: Project Initialization

## Risks & Mitigations

| Risk                    | Mitigation                     |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| SwiftData instability   | Have CoreData fallback plan    |
| Swift 6 adoption issues | Keep compatibility mode option |
| Complex navigation      | Simplify if needed             |

## Next Milestone Preview

With foundation complete, Milestone 2 will focus on implementing the first two services (Radarr and Sonarr) with full CRUD functionality.
