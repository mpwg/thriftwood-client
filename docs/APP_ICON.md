# Thriftwood App Icon

## Overview

The Thriftwood app icon features a stylized leaf design with warm orange and brown tones, symbolizing growth and natural organization - reflecting the app's purpose as a media management frontend.

## Icon Design

- **Concept**: Stylized leaf with tree branches
- **Primary Color**: Warm orange (#E67E22) - Also used as the app's accent color
- **Secondary Color**: Dark brown/burgundy
