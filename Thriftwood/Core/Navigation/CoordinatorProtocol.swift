import Foundation
import SwiftUI

/// Protocol defining the core requirements for all coordinators in the app.
///
/// **Current Usage (ADR-0012 - Pure MVVM):**
/// - `AppCoordinator`: Sole navigation authority, manages unified AppRoute enum
/// - `OnboardingCoordinator`: Child coordinator for onboarding flow only
/// - All other navigation handled directly by AppCoordinator without child coordinators
///
/// **File Naming Note**: This file is named `CoordinatorProtocol.swift` rather than
/// `Coordinator.swift` to clearly distinguish it from concrete coordinator implementations.
/// This naming convention helps avoid confusion when navigating the codebase.
///
/// Based on the coordinator pattern from Hacking with Swift, adapted for SwiftUI and pure MVVM.
/// Coordinators are responsible for managing navigation flow, removing this
/// responsibility from views and view models.
///
