/// Protocol defining the core requirements for all coordinators in the app.
///
/// **File Naming Note**: This file is named `CoordinatorProtocol.swift` rather than
/// `Coordinator.swift` to clearly distinguish it from concrete coordinator implementations
/// (AppCoordinator, TabCoordinator, etc.). This naming convention helps avoid confusion
/// when navigating the codebase and makes it immediately clear that this file contains
/// the protocol definition.
///
/// Based on the coordinator pattern from Hacking with Swift, adapted for SwiftUI.
/// Coordinators are responsible for managing navigation flow, removing this
/// responsibility from views and view models.
