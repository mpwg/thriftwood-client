/// Logic coordinator for Settings feature (ADR-0012: Simple MVVM)

/// **Role**: Business logic and service coordination for Settings
/// **Navigation**: Handled by AppCoordinator (single NavigationStack pattern)
///
/// This coordinator manages:
/// - Settings-related business logic
/// - Profile management coordination
/// - Preferences handling
///
/// **It does NOT manage navigation** - that's handled by AppCoordinator with unified AppRoute enum.
