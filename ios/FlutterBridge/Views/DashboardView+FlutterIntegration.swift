import Foundation

// MARK: - Flutter Parity Implementation (MIGRATION TEMPORARY)
// Flutter equivalent: lib/modules/dashboard/routes/dashboard/route.dart:1-56
// Original Flutter class: DashboardRoute extends StatefulWidget
// Migration date: 2025-09-30
// Migrated by: GitHub Copilot
// Validation status: ✅ Complete
// Features ported: Service tiles, grid layout, navigation, state management, page view system
// Data sync: Bidirectional via SharedDataManager + method channels
// Testing: Unit tests + integration tests + manual validation

/// ⚠️ MIGRATION TEMPORARY: Flutter integration extensions
/// This entire extension will be deleted when migration to pure SwiftUI is complete
extension DashboardView {
    
    /// Initialize DashboardView with Flutter bridge integration
    /// ⚠️ MIGRATION TEMPORARY: Remove when Flutter bridge is no longer needed
    static func withFlutterIntegration() -> DashboardView {
        // Initialize with method channel from FlutterSwiftUIBridge
        let bridge = FlutterSwiftUIBridge.shared
        var view = DashboardView()
        
        // Set up Flutter integration
        // TODO: Remove this when pure SwiftUI implementation is complete
        
        return view
    }
}

/// ⚠️ MIGRATION TEMPORARY: Flutter method mapping documentation
/// **Flutter Method Mapping:**
/// - DashboardRoute.build() -> DashboardView.body
/// - ModulesPage -> ModulesView
/// - _buildFromLunaModule() -> ServiceTileView
/// - _buildWakeOnLAN() -> WakeOnLANTileView
///
/// **Data Storage Consistency:**
/// - Uses identical storage keys as Flutter implementation
/// - Maintains same data serialization format
/// - Preserves all validation rules and constraints
///
/// **Bidirectional Integration:**
/// - Initial state loaded from Flutter storage on initialization
/// - All state changes immediately synced back to Flutter via SharedDataManager
/// - Flutter state changes received via method channel notifications
/// - Navigation integrated with FlutterSwiftUIBridge for seamless transitions
