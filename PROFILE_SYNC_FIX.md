# Profile Synchronization Fix

## Issue Summary

The SwiftUI settings view was showing "No Profile Selected" while the Flutter settings showed profiles correctly. This was due to a lack of synchronization between Flutter's Hive storage and SwiftUI's local storage.

## Root Cause

The SwiftUI `SettingsViewModel` was only attempting to load profile data from SwiftUI's local UserDefaults storage. When this was empty (as it would be on first use of SwiftUI settings), it would fall back to default empty settings instead of loading from Flutter's Hive storage.

## Files Modified

### 1. `/ios/Native/ViewModels/SettingsViewModel.swift`

**Changes:**

- **Enhanced `loadSettings()` method**: Now attempts to load from SwiftUI local storage first, then falls back to Flutter's Hive storage if local storage is empty
- **Improved initialization**: Ensures default profile exists during init to prevent empty state
- **Better `currentProfileName` logic**: Handles cases where no profile is selected more gracefully
- **Added debug method**: `testReloadFromHive()` for manual testing of Hive synchronization

**Key improvements:**

```swift
// First try SwiftUI local storage
if let loadedSettings = try await storageService.load(ThriftwoodAppSettings.self, forKey: "app_settings") {
    appSettings = loadedSettings
    loadedFromLocal = true
}

// If no local data exists, try to load from Flutter's Hive storage
if !loadedFromLocal {
    if let hiveSettings = try await dataManager.loadSettingsFromHive() {
        appSettings = hiveSettings
        // Save to local storage for future loads
        try await storageService.save(appSettings, forKey: "app_settings")
    }
}
```

### 2. `/ios/Native/Services/HiveDataManager.swift`

**Changes:**

- **Enhanced `loadSettingsFromHive()` method**: Added proper error handling for uninitialized method channel
- **Improved `syncSettings()` and `notifyProfileChange()`**: Added method channel availability checks
- **Better error reporting**: Clear warnings when method channel isn't available

### 3. `/lib/system/bridge/hive_bridge.dart` (NEW FILE)

**Purpose:** Dedicated Flutter-side handler for Hive data operations
**Features:**

- Handles `getHiveSettings` method calls from SwiftUI
- Converts Flutter Hive data to format expected by SwiftUI
- Supports profile synchronization, configuration export/import, and system operations
- Proper error handling and logging

**Key methods:**

- `_getHiveSettings()`: Retrieves current profiles and settings from Hive
- `_updateHiveSettings()`: Updates Hive storage with SwiftUI changes
- `_handleProfileChange()`: Handles profile switching from SwiftUI
- `_updateHiveProfile()`: Updates individual profile data

### 4. `/ios/Native/Bridge/FlutterSwiftUIBridge.swift`

**Changes:**

- **Added Hive method channel setup**: Creates separate `com.thriftwood.hive` channel for data sync
- **Initialize HiveDataManager**: Connects HiveDataManager with the Hive-specific method channel

### 5. `/lib/system/bridge/bridge_initializer.dart`

**Changes:**

- **Added HiveBridge initialization**: Ensures Hive bridge is set up during app startup

### 6. `/ios/Native/Views/SwiftUISettingsViews.swift`

**Changes:**

- **Added debug button**: "ðŸ”„ Test Hive Sync" button in System section for manual testing

## How It Works Now

1. **App Startup**:

   - BridgeInitializer sets up HiveBridge on Flutter side
   - FlutterSwiftUIBridge sets up method channels on iOS side
   - HiveDataManager connects to the `com.thriftwood.hive` channel

2. **SwiftUI Settings Load**:

   - SettingsViewModel tries to load from SwiftUI local storage
   - If empty, falls back to loading from Flutter's Hive storage via HiveBridge
   - Saves loaded data to local storage for future use
   - Sets up proper profile selection

3. **Data Synchronization**:
   - Changes in SwiftUI are synced back to Flutter's Hive storage
   - Changes in Flutter can be synced to SwiftUI storage
   - Both systems maintain consistent profile state

## Testing

### Manual Testing Steps:

1. **Launch app with existing Flutter profiles**
2. **Navigate to SwiftUI settings** (new settings)
3. **Verify profile is displayed correctly** (should show actual profile name, not "No Profile Selected")
4. **Use debug button** if needed: tap "ðŸ”„ Test Hive Sync" in System section
5. **Switch between old and new settings** to verify consistency

### Expected Results:

- âœ… SwiftUI settings should show the same profile as Flutter settings
- âœ… Profile name should be displayed correctly
- âœ… Service configurations should match between old and new settings
- âœ… Profile switching should work in both systems

## Error Handling

- Graceful fallback when method channel is not available
- Clear error messages and logging for debugging
- Default profile creation if no profiles exist
- Proper handling of corrupted or missing data

## Performance Considerations

- Hive data is loaded only when SwiftUI local storage is empty
- Once loaded, data is cached in SwiftUI local storage
- Synchronization is bidirectional but not real-time (on-demand)

## Future Improvements

1. Real-time synchronization between Flutter and SwiftUI
2. Better error recovery mechanisms
3. Profile conflict resolution
4. Background sync capabilities
