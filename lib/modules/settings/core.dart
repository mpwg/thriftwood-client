// SWIFT-FIRST MIGRATION: Settings core implementations eliminated
// All settings functionality now handled by Swift views
// This file kept minimal for compatibility during migration

// Legacy exports removed - functionality moved to Swift:
// - banners.dart -> SwiftUI native alerts
// - dialogs.dart -> SwiftUI native dialogs
// - pages.dart -> Swift SettingsView hierarchy
// - state.dart -> Swift SettingsViewModel
// - types.dart -> Swift data models
// - utilities.dart -> Swift utility functions
